# Image-Generator-Using-Custom-GANs

## Research Paper:
[Report](Report.pdf)



## Project Overview 
This project implements a Custom GAN using the CIFAR-10 dataset, focusing on generating realistic images of cats and dogs. Unlike traditional GANs, the discriminator in this model computes a similarity score between a real and a generated image, rather than classifying them as real or fake. The discriminator's goal is to maximize the dissimilarity score, while the generator aims to minimize it by producing images that closely resemble real cats and dogs. This approach leverages a novel similarity-based objective, encouraging the generator to create high-quality and realistic outputs of cats and dogs.

## Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 

## Libraries 
PyTorch: For Building the GAN Model <br>
matplotlib : For Graps 

## Techniques Used 
Generator : For Image Generation <br>
Discriminator: For Computing Similarity Score 

## Setup and Installination 
1) Clone the repository
2) Run the .ipynb file
3) Install the required libraries in the first cell using pip installl on your terminal
4) Install the CIFAR-10 Dataset- Code is already written in the JupyterNotebook
5) Train the GAN and generate images


## Results 
The generated results illustrate the potential of the custom GAN in synthesizing images of cats and dogs. The current outputs, while capturing the overall structure and features of the animals, appear blurry due to being trained on a limited number of epochs. This blurriness is expected to improve as the model is trained for more epochs with additional computational resources. With extended training, the generator is likely to produce sharper and more realistic images, demonstrating the effectiveness of the similarity-based discriminator in guiding the generation process.
